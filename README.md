Description
-----------

**Falcon Crawler** redefines the way people think about knowledge. By crawling popular communities like [Zhihu](http://www.zhihu.com/) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), it smartly provdies the top 5 most relevant questions you need to know about a topic. No endless googling nor tedious wikipedia reading, just **GIVE ME THE FIVE**!

Plan

Based on our experiences on web development and descriptions metioned above, we take _Feb, 2016_ as the __1st stage__ with the __primary__ goal of __prototyping__ our own generic web crawler. Here're some tentative schedules.

* __[2016/02/08 - 2016/02/14]__ Project Selection, Plan Discussion, and Proposal Draft Writing
* __[2016/02/15 - 2016/02/21]__ System Design, Resource Discovery, Project Implementation, Document Writing 
* __[2016/02/22 - 2016/02/28]__ User Manual Writing and Presentation Making

Language & Framework

JavaScript

Development Guildlines
----------------------

- __Modularity.__ Following the principle _"loose coupling and high cohesion"_, each module should be standalone.

- __Minimalism.__ Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. 
- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
